Features that I want to be in here:
    - Print entire cost database
    - add custom receipes if wanted 
        -> requires alternative name, deletetion of old entry
    - restore original entry of a mat
    - enter 1 mat -> comprehensive cost rundown
    - restore entire table if needed

future features:
    - auto fetch data from wiki


potential issues:
    - if different buildings contain alt recipes for the same mat, then multiple entries will be created witht he same name, violating the UNIQUE constraint
