# Feature(s)

What this script does, is that you can enter Materials like "Reinforced Iron Plate", a multiplier, and it will give you the amount of Smelters/Constructors/etc you need to build in order to fully run one full batch of your Material

## example:

Recipe: "Reinforced Iron Plate"
Amount: 1
Output: [('Iron Plate', 3.0), ('Screw', 3.0), ('Iron Rod', 2.0), ('Iron Ingot', 4.0)]
Which means to produce one batch (in the case of RIP, that would be 5/min), we need: 
- 4 Smelters Producing Iron
- 2 Constructors Producing Iron Rods
- 3 Constructors Producing Screws
- 3 Constructors Producing Iron Plates
