# How this works:

Basically, I create a SQL DB with handler.py, Fill the tables with CreateDB.py, with data (Sourcecode of the webpages correspondign to smelters, assemblers etc.) I got from satisfactory wiki.

I then recursively Query the database to then give the output using frontend.py and Query.py
